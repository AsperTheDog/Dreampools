	"letter1": "Hey Darling!\n\nHow are you doing over there? Here things are a bit messy, but we are doing alright. You know how your father gets all the time, he’s constantly frowning because we left and is trying to convince everyone to go back home. I don’t know if he understands we can’t go back. I know these are complicated times for you, being away from us and all, but just know that we miss you and can’t wait to see you. So make sure to come here as soon as you can, okay?\n\nI love you\nMom",
	"letter2": "Hello Darling.\n\nHow are you doing? It’s been so long since we last heard from you so I thought I would send you one more letter. You have been taking care of yourself, right? Your father has been very altered lately, he keeps saying we want to abandon him. I think he is just feeling homesick. In any case, we really miss you. I would expect you to be here already, are you doing alright? Try not to get distracted on your way here, okay? We will be waiting for you on this side.\n\nI love you\nMom",
	"letter3": "Hello Darling.\n\nI don’t even know if you receive these letters at all. We miss you, sweetie, I am scared something might have happened to you. If you do read this letter just know we are going to keep waiting for you. We can wait forever, time stands still here. So do not give up, okay? We are with you. Don’t be scared to keep on moving forward. Don’t worry how dark it seems or how much you have to walk, just don’t stop, okay?\n\nI love you\nMom",
	"letter4": "Poor boy\n\nWe have been waiting so long\nWe have been waiting for someone \nWho will not come\nWe waited for hours\nWe waited for decades\nWe have waited with bated breath\nBut he who we have waited for\nWill never come\nHe does not know himself"
